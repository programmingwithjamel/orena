                Happy Valentine's Day Rena🥰😘💖
                There's a saying that goes like this: <span>&#8223;Anyone can catch your eye, but it takes someone special to catch your heart&#8221;</span> and NGL in the space of a month you have caught mine.
                Every moment on the phone with you feels like magic, talking to you now happens to be the best part of my day.
                I'm glad I met you and you're actually an amazing, awesome, cute, pretty, beautiful person😍🤭 just like the forehead won't give you chance la all😭😭.
                Like bro you're living in my head rent free and I can't get you out, it's like your have taken over my brain and I'm not even mad about  its's all yours baby control it😭😍 .
                When I picture myself happy these days only one person comes to mind (YOU).
                I only want two things in this world: I want you and I want us. 
                I love you Rena, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY🥰😘💖.
